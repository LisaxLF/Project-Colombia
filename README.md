# Project Colombia

## Description

During our information design minor, we were given the choice of 6 different assignments from external clients for our final project. After hearing pitches for each assignment, the three of us decided to work on the Colombia project by Jan Rothuizen and Juul Spee. The origin of the case arose because Jan creates all his drawings analogously and wants to digitize them, making them accessible to a larger audience. It was our task to make this realization possible. Leveraging our knowledge and skills from CMD Amsterdam, we embarked on the journey to digitally transform his art in an innovative and interactive manner.
